### Parts

#### Units and cards

You can structure the knowledge in units independent of the size of their content.
Different aspects of each unit will be managed in tabs. These tabs may contain text in Markdown format (such as definitions and examples), images, UML representation or code.

#### Preparation of itineraries: itineraries and views

In the itinerary manager you can edit the different itineraries of a unit. These itineraries will consist of a series of views of either theoretical or practical type, which will have tokens or exercises respectively.

#### Exercises

You can put exercises in the itineraries, these exercises can be of two types: definitions and listings. Each exercise wants to manage the different responses of the students.

#### Student profile

The student's profile can consult the units and their itineraries, answer the exercises and track their progress
